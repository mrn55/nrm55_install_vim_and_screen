# nrm55_install_vim_and_screen

A simple script that helps deploy my vimrc and screenrc quicker than manually

# Example Usage

1: Instead of manually cloning, I use this 1 liner (3 commands):
```
git clone https://github.com/nrm55/nrm55_install_vim_and_screen.git;chmod +x nrm55_install_vim_and_screen/nrm55_install_vim_and_screen.sh; nrm55_install_vim_and_screen/nrm55_install_vim_and_screen.sh
```
The above just not on one line:
```
git clone https://github.com/nrm55/nrm55_install_vim_and_screen.git
chmod +x nrm55_install_vim_and_screen/nrm55_install_vim_and_screen.sh
nrm55_install_vim_and_screen/nrm55_install_vim_and_screen.sh
```
